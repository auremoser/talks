###Q&A
####TITLE
OSScientific Method: How to use open source tech to build open research practice

####SUMMARY
Scientific study has often stressed the importance of reproducible results, but sometimes less-so the value of knowledge-sharing throughout the research process. The pressure to publish and preserve a patent on research results inhibits progress toward open, collaborative investigation. With the development of bioinformatics and computationally-driven research in the hard sciences, the potential to galvanize a network in the open web, and thereby support a study with community, continues to reshape how we think about research. Projects like [Research Kit](http://www.apple.com/researchkit/?cid=wwa-us-kwm-iphone), the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), and open source programs like [Mozilla's Collaborate](https://www.mozillascience.org/collaborate) have worked to make tools and community-building part of the modern scientific methodologies, with great results.

This session will address the future of education for computational scientists, and how partnering with curriculum producers, collaborative coders, and community members has fostered a supportive crew of stellar researchers across domains. We'll be soliciting opinion from anyone who's passionate about supporting scientific research on the web. How can we amplify science projects released openly on the web and promote a program of open science for all? Join us to learn about how we do it at the Mozilla Science Lab, and how you can help!

####BIO
Aurelia is a developer and curious chemist building communities around code at the Mozilla Science Lab. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security, and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South. 

Stuart is  a Map Scientist with CartoDB a company that specializes in beautiful online geospatial visualizations and location analytics.

He initially studied mathematical physics at Edinburgh University before deciding astronomy was prettier and easier to explain in bars and obtained a Ph.D. in astrophysics. He currently works at the Adler Planetarium as the technical lead of the Zooniverse: the largest collection of online citizen science projects. He is passionate about getting everyone involved in doing real science and making real discoveries online.
