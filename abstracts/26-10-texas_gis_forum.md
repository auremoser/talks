####TITLE
GIS Lessons: Learning to Query and Code with the CartoDB Academy

####SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. Learning how to make compelling maps with your own data is a a non-trivial endeavor, involving a concatenation of expertise and technical aptitudes with specialty tools that might be obscure to new mappers, and limits the community as a result. At [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), we have a series of open source projects to augment the GIS learning experience, with [Academy](http://academy.cartodb.com/), our "code academy" for GIS, or our [Trainings repository](http://cartodb.github.io/training/), a place to share lessons and workshops and submit events to a collaborative calendar.

We'll talk about the future of education for digital geographers, and how partnering with curriculum producers has fostered a supportive community of stellar mappers across domains. Join us to learn about how we do it, and how you can help!

####BIO
Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at CartoDB. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South.

Andy Eschbacher is a physicist turned educator turned map scientist. At CartoDB he wears many hats. From finding out how to make web maps more scientific with hacks on open source software, to developing educational content, to sharing and learning from the diverse online mapping community, he and his colleagues keep very busy.
