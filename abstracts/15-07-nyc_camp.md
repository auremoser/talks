####Title
Building Dynamic Maps with CartoDB

####Abstract
CartoDB is an open-source mapping platform allowing users to design, publish, share and learn about maps online. It automates the building of maps from dynamic data, applies style and query functions from CSS and SQL standards, and implements customizations to both UI and data structure components on the fly. The easy-to-use Editor runs in your web browser and enables mapmaking in minutes. More custom integrations of maps into your own applications is as easy as leveraging the CartoDB APIs and libraries, which extend the Editor functionality with PostGIS SQL and Javascript.

You can make an interactive map in minutes, or build a custom map with heightened functionality and more control via our tools. Recent efforts to improve our community support have had us building additional tutorials to teach users how to make maps, how to write JS and PostGISQL, and how to customize their visualizations with code. This session will cover how we build community with Academy, our online, interactive tutorial platform designed to educate our community and support their efforts to make beautiful maps.
