###Q+A
**Provide Qualifications (list your strong skills and indicate if you have attended this or any other Hackathon in the past, and where):**
I've been a developer for about 4 years now, working mostly in Javascript and Python, you can check out my projects/code resume on Github: https://github.com/auremoser. I've built several open source projects with public data that are all listed on github, and contributed to many more close-source projects for the tech companies I've worked for over the past few years. Last year, I worked at Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, on primarily open source mapping software for crisis mapping and election monitoring, and executed a few client projects on a hackathon-esque deadline, one of those I blogged about there, a collaboration with an agricultural NGO in Tanzania: http://blog.cartodb.com/map-of-the-week-pulse-plotting/.

**If yes, please provide more details: When and where, type of event, technology used, the product developed, how many people in your team.**
For the above linked project with Vital Signs,  I was the lead tech developer, collaborators were scientists and ngo workers in Tanzania, and within a week I built a process to clean and standardize their data, visualize it with a map and interactive graphing tool. The project underwent a few versioned tweeks because of the low-bandwidth for operators in the SAGCOT region of Tanzania, and the deadline was crazy-fast because they were racing to a funding presentation with their grant investors that week. You can find the code and documentation on my github here: https://github.com/auremoser/VitalSigns-water/tree/master

**List all of the web applications such as Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and mobile (iOS/Android) applications with third-party API dependencies that you are excellent at (10 out 10):**
I mostly write front-end code, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and some Python. I'm familiar with working with multiple 3rd party APIs, but we have a few APIs internally that we've open sourced and are particularly useful for mapping visualizations (Import-API, Maps-API, SQL-API). You can check out the sample documentation on those here: http://docs.cartodb.com/cartodb-platform/import-api.html (browse the menubar for links to the other apis). I've attended hackdays where API integration of a certain type were obligatory for attendance, and those run the gamut from the Donor's Choose API (for integration with a charitable donation platform), to the Twilio API (for integration with a phone #/ calling service), to the Google Docs/Spreadsheets API (for porting data from collaborative data/documentation).

**Did you win in previous Hackathons? Provide information on the Hackathon/event, description of your project, rank, and URLâ€™s for the Hackathons**
I won a hackathon last year in Aarhus Denmark for a Data Journalism Conference run by the chapter of Hacks/Hackers in Copenhagen. We built the prototype for a platform that would allow you to search by country; our android application is in the ap store, but I believe the web-version proof of concept is still live, and documented/code available here:
https://github.com/auremoser/geonewsies.
Last weekend I attended and worked on a project for a Hacking Journalism Hackday devoted to developing new paradigms and tools for video journalism, and we worked on an application to concatenate and scroll through videos of a certain hashtag on Vine: http://videonyc.hackdash.org/ (documentation and repository is in the "Scrubber" Project link).

**Would you like to give a lightening talk during the Hackathon (15 minutes)?**
Of course.

**If, yes, provide us with details for the session title and few paragraph descriptions and outline of topics and technologies?**
####Making Sense of Sensor Data With Maps

Growth in affordable hardware for sensor data collection is inspiring distributed data mapping globally. From wearables to arduinos, non-profits and NGOs are leveraging small sensor kits as windows into environmental and ecological health, and mapping sensor data meshes increasingly informs how we appreciate the topography of our world. Still, the parsing and processing of these data in meaningful ways remains a non-trivial challenge for most organizations. At CartoDB, we're working on ways to make this more intuitive, and improve access to geo-referenced sensor data for all.

This session will tackle a few sensor data case studies powered by a FOSS stack in the domains of :

* water quality/availability
* agricultural security
* ecological sustainability
* animal migration

And we'll discuss:

* sensor data types, kits, and hardware components
* data transformation, cleaning and parsing
* mapping data dynamically and statically for public sharing

We'll explore some of the challenges to mapping and graphing sensor data via a few case studies in the non-profit field and a few tools (CartoDB, Ushahidi) in the open source space.

**Provide a brief bio of yourself to include on our website incase you are selected (max of 200 words).**
Aurelia is a librarian, developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at CartoDB. Her background blends science and scripting and include a cocktail of conservation chemistry, eco-enthusiasm, education, and egalitarian tech activism. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had her working with mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South.

**Feel free to provide us with comments, suggestions, ideas for apps to implement during the Hackathon, or topics that students might like to hear about during this event.**
It's helpful to have a list of suggested data sets or resources and some guidance about or imposed team-formation prior to the event. I find that hackathons can get unwieldy if those things are not prepared in advance.
