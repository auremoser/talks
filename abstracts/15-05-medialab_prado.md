####TITLE
Visualizing Flux: Mapping Matter, Making Change

####SUMMARY
Maps are a pretty persistent part of how we plot history, how we cartographically comprehend our present, and how might process a topographical trajectory of our future. They provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they offer a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. Providing a view of the world that speaks to a broad population requires an approach to open source and open information that is flexible, adaptable, and driven by an objective to demonstrate progress, in essence, to visualize flux.

CartoDB is an open source mapping platform that helps people parse and visualize geospatial data. Built as a friendly front-end for a PostGres DB, we host geospatial information and let users query across their uploaded data with ease, and loads of visualization options. Our software is open source and supports a library of "Common Data" for supplementing visualization projects with additional dataAlong with the core platform, we've built a few libraries to help journalists and novice technologists tell stories with data...like Torque, our library for time-series data, and Odyssey.js, our library for building chapterized data with focused navigation for crafting the perfect narrative.

This talk will highlight these projects, showcasing maps as an ideal format for building beautiful visualizations with open data that compliment a narrative arc in flux.
