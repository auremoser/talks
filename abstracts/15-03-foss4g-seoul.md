### FOSS4G - Seoul

####Title
Making Sense of Sensor Data with Maps

####Abstract

Growth in affordable hardware for sensor data collection is inspiring distributed data mapping globally. From wearables to arduinos, non-profits and NGOs are leveraging small sensor kits as windows into environmental and ecological health, and mapping sensor data meshes increasingly informs how we appreciate the topography of our world. Still, the parsing and processing of these data in meaningful ways remains a non-trivial challenge for most organizations. At CartoDB, we're working on ways to make this more intuitive, and improve access to geo-referenced sensor data for all.

This session will tackle a few sensor data case studies powered by a FOSS stack in the domains of:
* water quality/availability
* agricultural security
* ecological sustainability
* animal migration

And we'll discuss:
* sensor data types, kits, and hardware components
* data transformation, cleaning and parsing
* mapping data dynamically and statically for public sharing

We'll explore some of the challenges to mapping and graphing sensor data via a few case studies in the non-profit field and a few tools (CartoDB, Ushahidi) in the open source space.
