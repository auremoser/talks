####TITLE
Making Sense of Data with Maps: Crafting Narrative with Time-series GeoData and CartoDB
####SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. For certain types of complex data, this can translate otherwise overwhelming and obscure information to a usable interface; at CartoDB, we've been working on building open source tools and tutorials to enable this kind of narrative craft with sensor, spatial, and temporal datasets in specific, and some common but complicated data in general. This session will review the basics of understanding geo-spatial information and appropriate open source mapping/charting tools to process and visualize those data into meaningful maps. We'll be reviewing ways to clean and filter data, ways to author PostGIS functions for querying geospatial information, and ways to customize rendering with Javascript and CartoCSS to build beautiful visualizations that compliment a narrative arc of spacetime proportions.
