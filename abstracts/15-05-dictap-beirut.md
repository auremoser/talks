###Q&A
####TITLE
Code + Cartography: Building Data-Driven Narrative with CartoDB and PostGIS

####SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography. This workshop will review the basics of understanding geo-spatial information and appropriate open source mapping/charting tools to process and visualize those data. We'll be reviewing ways to clean and filter data, ways to author PostGIS functions for querying geospatial information, and ways to customize rendering with javascript and CartoCSS to build beautiful, custom maps. 

####TOPICS
Maps, Javascript, geospatial data, PostGRES/PostGIS

####FORMAT/DURATION
1.5-2 hours (I can also give a 30 minute talk or otherwise adjust my time according to your needs)

Aurelia Moser
Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at CartoDB. Her background blends science and scripting and include a cocktail of conservation chemistry, eco-enthusiasm, education, and egalitarian tech activism. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had her working with mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apiaries globally. She also co-organizes the hub chapter of Girl Develop It, a non-profit that teaches women how to code and is on the Advisory Board for Beautiful Rising, a technology collective building open source toolkits for activists throughout the Global South.
