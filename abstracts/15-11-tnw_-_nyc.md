####TITLE

Mapping the Matrix: Multi-dimensional Cartography with Scientific and Spatial Data

####SUMMARY

Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines, satisfying studies in curiosity beyond terrestrial cartography. Likewise, learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to scientific study, making sense of our world visually and physically in intuitive 2D or 3D topographies. At CartoDB, we're working on building open source mapping software for the masses, enabling citizen cartography at macro and micro levels. We've built a suite of libraries and APIs to process and render time-series, vector, and raster data with ease; all-the-while releasing regular sprints of analytics toolsets to test out what people map and why, redirecting that study to inform how we can encourage better maps and easier geospatial analysis in the browser. This talk would cover how maps can provide complex information with spatial clarity: where orbital maps drive an understanding subatomic dynamics at one zoom, and help us understand interactions in our cosmos at another. 

####BIO
Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at CartoDB. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South.
