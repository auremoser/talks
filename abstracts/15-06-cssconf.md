###TITLE
Stylish Slippy Maps: Creativity with CartoCSS

###SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they allow us to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography. We build mythologies with maps: stylized captures of how we might see the world. Part of that storytelling process depends on the feature flux of the slippy map, a digital map that demands pretty flex design for interactivity and ZUI navigation of cartography. Design details become pretty important when you're flattening a 3D world into a 2D projection of presumed reality, so this talk will go over how we might creatively style maps, munge data, and build mythology with integrity and pure CartoCSS.
