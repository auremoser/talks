####TITLE
Flux and Future Narratives: Storytelling with Spacetime Data and Torque

####SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. For certain types of complex data, this can translate otherwise overwhelming and obscure information to a usable interface; at [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), we've been working on building open source tools and tutorials to enable this kind of narrative craft with mashups of geospatial information and time-series data. We designed [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) as a library to give temporal dimension to mapped data, and we use it in partnership with [OdysseyJS](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/) to craft geo-narrative in code. I'll be reviewing ways visualize data with maps, ways to jumble, sort and query geospatial information, and ways to customize rendering with Javascript and CartoCSS to build beautiful visualizations that compliment a narrative arc of spacetime proportions.

####BIO
Aurelia is a developer and curious cartographer building communities around code at CartoDB. Previously of Ushahidi and Internews Kenya, she's been working in the open tech and non-profit journalism space for a few years, and recent projects have had mapping sensor data to support agricultural security and sustainable apis ecosystems in the Global South.
