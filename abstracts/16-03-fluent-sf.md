####TITLE

Mapping the Matrix: Open Cartography with Scientific and Spatial Data

####ABSTRACT
Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines, satisfying studies in curiosity beyond terrestrial cartography. This session will demostrate the application of geospatial analysis to scientific data, and illustrate how web mapping can be applied to research and results-driven scientific study in the browser.

####SUMMARY
Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines, satisfying studies in curiosity beyond typical cartography. Likewise, learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to scientific study, making sense of our world visually and physically in intuitive 2D or 3D topographies. At all scales, this skill can provide complex information with spatial clarity: where orbital maps drive an understanding subatomic dynamics at one zoom, and help us understand interactions in our cosmos at another. Still, sometimes the tools to build maps can be as obscure and proprietary as the data we are trying to parse, and developing fluency in both scientific and spatial analysis can be a non-trivial effort for web developers.

At CartoDB, we're working on open source libraries to make mapping better for scientists, processing larger amounts of data to render scientific results, and building a suite of libraries and APIs to process and render time-series, vector, and raster data with ease. We're also releasing regular sprints of analytics toolsets to test out what people map and why, redirecting that study to inform how we can encourage better maps and easier geospatial analysis in the browser.

####TAKEAWAY
The session will provide an introduction to open libraries and APIs for web mapping, this will include:
* some introduction to spatial analysis via CartoDB's SQL API and PostGIS functions
* mapping time-series information dynamically with Torque.js
* scientific, vector and raster rendering with Vecnik.js

####AUDIENCE
Anyone with some basic familiarity building maps for the web via Google Maps APIs, CartoDB, Mapbox, or ArcMap will be comfortable in this session. I hesitate to make this an intermediate session, but I will be going over some Javascript methods, CartoCSS, PostGIS query authorship so some basic familiarity might be of use as prep.
