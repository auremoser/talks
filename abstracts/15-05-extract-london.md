####TITLE
Visualizing Flux: Storytelling with Time, Space, and Torque

####SUMMARY
Maps are a pretty persistent part of how we plot history, how we cartographically comprehend our present, and how might process a topographical trajectory of our future. They provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they offer a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. CartoDB is an open source mapping platform that helps people parse and visualize geospatial data. Built as a friendly front-end for a PostGres DB, we host geospatial information and let users query across their uploaded data with ease, and loads of visualization options. Along with the core platform, we've built a few libraries to help journalists and novice technologists tell stories with data...like Torque, our library for time-series data, and Odyssey.js, our library for building chapterized data with focused navigation for crafting the perfect narrative.

This talk will highlight these projects, showcasing maps as an ideal format for building beautiful visualizations that compliment a narrative arc of spacetime proportions.
