###Q&A
####TITLE
Visualizing Flux: Storytelling with Time, Space, and Torque

####SUMMARY
Maps provide us with some of the most intuitive ways to represent data visually, principally because they provide a way to rectify our physical locality with some digital and data-dense topography; they help us build narrative with relevant geolocation and let us tell trends with data on a geospatial-sensitive canvas. For certain types of complex data, this can translate otherwise overwhelming and obscure information to a usable interface; at [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), we've been working on building open source tools and tutorials to enable this kind of narrative craft with mashups of geospatial information and time-series data. We designed [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) as a library to give temporal dimension to mapped data, and we use it in partnership with [OdysseyJS](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/) to craft geo-narrative in code. I'll be reviewing ways to clean and filter data, ways to author PostGIS functions for querying geospatial information, and ways to customize rendering with Javascript and CartoCSS to build beautiful visualizations that compliment a narrative arc of spacetime proportions.
