####TITLE

Mapping the Universe: Open Cartography with Scientific and Spatial Data

####ABSTRACT:

Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines, satisfying studies in curiosity beyond typical cartography. Likewise, learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to scientific study, making sense of our world visually and physically in intuitive 2D or 3D topographies. At all scales, this skill can provide complex information with spatial clarity: where orbital maps drive an understanding subatomic dynamics at one zoom, and help us understand interactions in our cosmos at another. Still, sometimes the tools to build maps can be as obscure and proprietary as the data we are trying to parse, and developing fluency in both scientific and spatial analysis can be a non-trivial effort for web developers.

At CartoDB, we're working on open source libraries to make mapping better for scientists, processing larger amounts of data to render scientific results, and building a suite of libraries and APIs to process and render time-series, vector, and raster data with ease. We're also releasing regular sprints of analytics toolsets to test out what people map and why, redirecting that study to inform how we can encourage better maps and easier geospatial analysis in the browser. 

This session will go over managing scientific and spatial data, filtering and parsing it with SQL and PostGIS support, and styling maps with dynamic data in CartoCSS. We'll also discuss more advanced mapping Ã  la our partners at [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/), and their work to open data about conservation and forest preservation globally.
