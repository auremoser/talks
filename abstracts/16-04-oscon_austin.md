####TITLE

Map the Planet: Open Cartography with Scientific and Spatial Data

#####SHORT
Learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to making sense of our world visually and physically, and a solid contributor to scientific research. This talk will be a brief intro to open source mapping tools for scientific and environmental study, and in particular will case study terrestrial mapping with Global Forest Watch and planet mapping for Where on Mars?

####SUMMARY
Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines. Likewise, learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to making sense of our world visually and physically, and a solid contributor to scientific research. 

At all scales, cartography can provide complex information with spatial clarity: where orbital maps drive an understanding subatomic dynamics at one zoom, and help us understand interactions in our cosmos at another. Still, sometimes the tools to build maps can be as obscure as the data we are trying to parse, and the process of geocoding these data can be beyond the experience of accessible toolkit of the average developer.

This talk will be a brief intro to open source mapping tools for scientific and environmental study, and in particular will case study terrestrial mapping with Global Forest Watch and planet mapping for Where on Mars? to help tease out the tough parts of geocoding on real and mythical spatial matrixes.

####TAGS
geospatial data, cartography, geocoding, javascript, open source science, research

####PREREQUES
Some understanding of JS/HTML/CSS will be helpful for making use of the libraries mentioned. A basic background in data visualization or map-making for the web would be helpful but not obligatory. 

####TAKEAWAY
The audience will walk with exposure to a few open mapping libraries (for scripting languages primarily), some understanding of open and closed-source geocoders, and tools then help anyone plot points/lines/polygons on a webmap.

####NOTES
It would be lovely, since I'm now contracting, any assistance would be helpful.
I also spoke at last year's OSCON and I think it went pretty well! But I can't seem to find the video so I included videos from other talks. Thanks so much!
