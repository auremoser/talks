####TITLE

Map the Planet: Open Cartography with Scientific and Spatial Data

####SUMMARY
Maps are popular visualizations applied to all scientific disciplines. Likewise, learning how to best apply cartographic tools to spatial problems is an important component to making sense of our world visually and physicially. At all scales, this skill can provide complex information with spatial clarity: where orbital maps drive an understanding subatomic dynamics at one zoom, and help us understand interactions in our cosmos at another. Still, sometimes the tools to build maps can be as obscure as the data we are trying to parse, and the process of geocoding these data can be beyond the experience of accessible toolkit of the average developer.

This talk will be a brief intro to open source mapping tools for scientific and environmental study, and in particular will case study terrestrial mapping with Global Forest Watch and planet mapping for Where on Mars?
