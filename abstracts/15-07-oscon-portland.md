###Title: 
Visualizing Flux: Time Travel, Torque and Temporal Maps

###Description:
Maps are part of our visual vocabulary and the historical versioning of maps defines some of the most fascinating social, political and environmental flux of precedent. Everything from the eruption of post-World Cup tweets, to the diaspora of refugees across political frontiers, to the migration patterns of sea mammals can be mapped with software that is spatially and temporally sensitive, and perhaps it should.
At CartoDB, we make open source mapping software for the masses, with free libraries for coders, friendly tutorials and guis for newbies, and copious guides online to help you build a beautiful map with your data. I'll be talking about how we integrate OSM data, partner with NGOs and academics, and provide free services to support various community-made maps with open-source PostGres in the cloud. Much of our work centers around building an online sandbox for our tools like Odyssey.JS and CartoDB, that we then port to libraries and APIS (MapsAPI, SQLAPI, ImportAPI, Static MapsAPI)for coders with more experience. This talk will cover time travel as it can be viewed in visualizations, focusing on our temporal mapping library Torque, our time-lapse heatmaps, and the ways we partner public time-series data with interactive maps.
