### FOSS4G - Seoul - Workshop

####Title
Building Dynamic Maps with CartoDB

####Abstract
CartoDB is an open-source mapping platform allowing users to design, publish, and share maps online. It automates the building of maps from dynamic data, applies style and query functions from CSS and SQL standards, and implements customizations to both UI and data structure components on the fly. The easy-to-use Editor runs in your web browser and enables mapmaking in minutes. More custom integrations of maps into your own applications is as easy as leveraging the CartoDB APIs and libraries, which extend the Editor functionality with PostGIS SQL and Javascript.

Here we will show you how to go from your data to interactive maps in just 30 seconds. We'll guide you through map-publishing in the Editor GUI, and expand on this for additional customization via the open libraries and APIs. The prerequisites are minimal; everyone is invited to attend, but participants will review geo-spatial data formatting, SQL querying, styling with CartoCSS, and the mechanics of map integration with CartoJS.
