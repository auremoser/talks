####TITLE
This is Not a Map: Building Interactive Maps with Creative Themes and Geometries

####DESCRIPTION
The meaning of "map" across disciplines is remarkably varied. It's effectively a spatial representation of geo-topography, a linking between tables by foreign key, a datatype in C++... At CartoDB, users make creative use of our custom basemaps feature, building remarkable maps of multivariate information off-the-(beaten) geographic projection. Many have designed and published interactive maps of cemetery burial plots, galactic drawings of the Star Wars Universe, heatmaps of court traffic during the NBA finals. Let's explore other maps, and investigate topic and themes not yet covered in interactives...talk about how to map them, and why mapping unmapped data might be the perfect expression of their meaning.

####AGENDA
I would like to arrange it as a collaborative session: a short introduction to the topic with some projected examples followed by some group hacking and discussion over etherpad. In the past, I've organized very successful sessions at MozFest and SRCCON with this format. 

####AUDIENCE
I like a low-stress introduction to familiarize everyone with the subject and relax attendees followed by break up into small groups. For 50 participants this would be an agreeable breakdown by topic/theme (humanities maps, medical maps, urban infrastructure maps, use of mapping software for personal maps); likewise 15 is a great number for breakdown by 5, with smaller groups the collaboration is even more aggreeable. In any case, it would be wonderful and manageable, as the session is based on crowdsourcing.

####OUTCOMES
I think everyone would leave with a new perspective on mapping, and what is possible in terms of creative visualization of open or personalized data. Developers of relational datasets are always seeking new ways to make sense of that information, and progress in the GIS community toward building better open source tools that support visualization of varied data has been remarkable in the past few years. I'd like to bridge these communities through examples of others who already have, and hopefully provide everyone a general breakdown of creative mapping projects to inspire their future projects. At the same time, I doubtless have a lot to learn
