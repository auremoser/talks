####TITLE

This is Not a Map: Building Interactive Maps with Creative Themes and Geometries

####SUMMARY

The meaning of "map" across disciplines is remarkably varied. It's effectively a spatial representation of geo-topography, a linking between tables by foreign key, a datatype in C++... Today, coders make creative use of custom basemaps, building remarkable maps of multivariate information off-the-(beaten) geographic projection. Many have designed and published interactive maps of cemetery burial plots, galactic drawings of the Star Wars Universe, sequence maps of human genes, heatmaps of court traffic during the NBA finals. This talk will explore other maps, and investigate topics and themes not yet covered in interactives...detailing how to map them, and why mapping unmapped data might be the perfect expression of their meaning.
