###Q&A
####TITLE
Visualizing Flux: data visualization to monitor matter and make change

####SUMMARY
When we plot information visually we monitor how it changes over time and what population or location it impacts. Whether you are mapping transportation infrastructure to study accessibility, graphing policy data in a time-series to point out a need for revision, or illustrating correlates between disparate entities to highlight dependencies, you are building a way for people to process change, and hopefully a way for them to articulate an action for an informed and progressive future. This talk will run through some tools for mapping multivariate data, and ways to process change visually and then, actionably.

####TOPICS
Maps, Javascript, geospatial data, PostGRES/PostGIS
